<h>I had been struggling with concentration on long, intense tasks when I came across the <a href = "https://heyfocus.com/blog/how-to-use-pomodoro-to-boost-your-focus-and-productivity/"> the Pomodoro methodology</a>. It was a bit painful to keep resetting alarms and timers on my phone and hence, decided to build one in Python.</h5>
