This is an app I am making for my dad. He is an ardent investor in companies but finds it hard to navigate the ad-ridden and click-baitey news websites to find the information he wants. Hence, this app does a few things:<br>

<ol>
  <li>Allows you to add a list of stocks to track #to-do</li>
  <li>Checks the closing prices of the stocks for the last week</li>
  <li>Charts out the progress of the price for the last month #to-do</li>
  <li>If the difference between two consecutive closing prices is greater than a pre-defined threshold, gather all the news items about the stock in the last 7 days</li>
  <li>Display the headlines of each article</li>
  </ol>
