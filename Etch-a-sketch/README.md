<a href ="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle">Turtle graphics</a> is a popular way for introducing programming to kids. It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon in 1967.

Imagine a robotic turtle starting at (0, 0) in the x-y plane. After an import turtle, give it the command turtle.forward(15), and it moves (on-screen!) 15 pixels in the direction it is facing, drawing a line as it moves. Give it the command turtle.right(25), and it rotates in-place 25 degrees clockwise.

By combining together these and similar commands, intricate shapes and pictures can easily be drawn.

Turtle allowed me to mockup some interesting interfaces / screens for the Snake game and for this Etch a Sketch app

  ## How to run the app:
  ```
  python main.py
  ```
