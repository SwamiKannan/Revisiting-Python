I am using this Github repo to build a few Python skills especially in GUI interfaces, non-ML projects, web-based API and maybe, even build a few Python games. I intend to build atleast one new app every 2-3 days. Hopefully, I stay consistent !

This is an exploration of building various Python applications which are non-ML but can built around ML models. Key libraries include:
<ul>
  <li>Turtle</li>
  <li>Tkinter</li>
  <li>Cryptography</li>
  </ul>
